# Weekend learning

Collection of cumulative learning on weekends

Goal of this repo is to write about my learnings every weekend. This will help me in going through my previous work when required but should also help others to gain from this.  

## Weekend #1

+ [Logistic Regression from scratch](Deep-Learning/perceptron_logistic_regression.ipynb)
+ [Pytorch basics](Deep-Learning/pytorch_basics.ipynb)
