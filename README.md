# Week-basis learning

Collection of cumulative learning on week by week

Goal of this repo is to write about my learnings every week. This will help me in going through my previous work when required but should also help others to gain from this.  

## Week #1

+ [Logistic Regression - Single perceptron](Deep-Learning/perceptron_logistic_regression.ipynb)
+ [Pytorch basics](Deep-Learning/pytorch_basics.ipynb)
+ [Simple 2-layer Neural Network](Deep-Learning/simple_neural_network.ipynb)
+ [MNIST Dataset Neural Network](Deep-Learning/mnist_neural_network.ipynb)
+ [Horses or Humans Custom Neural Network](Deep-Learning/horses_or_humans_nn.ipynb)

## Week #2

+ [Transfer Learning on Horses or Humans Dataset](Deep-Learning/TransferLearning/horses_or_humans_model.ipynb)
